# Background/Motivation

On September 28, 2018, a powerful earthquake measuring 7.4 in magnitude hit Indonesia’s central province of Sulawesi, leading to a destructive tsunami with waves reaching approximately 20 feet in height. This resulted in the death of 250,000 people and caused an economic loss estimated at 9.9 billion US dollars [1]. 

Each year, natural disasters affect millions of people and cause economic losses amounting to billions of US dollars. In 2023 alone, at least 399 natural disasters occurred, leading to an economic loss of 207.2 billion dollars and affecting at least 93.1 million people [2]. The number of natural disasters per year has been significantly increasing in recent years, exacerbated by climate change. While both developed and developing nations experience natural disasters, low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately impacted. Since the 1970s, at least 95% of deaths from climate and weather-related disasters have occurred in developing countries [3], and losses due to natural hazards are 20 times greater in developing countries than in developed countries [4]. This burden on developing countries has the potential to compound existing inequalities and widen the wealth gap between developing and developed countries.

Humanitarian aid during natural disasters is integral to helping developing countries respond to these crises and it is even more important now with the significant increase in natural disasters ravaging developing countries due to climate change. These response efforts include coordination and collaboration between different stakeholders and agencies, both local and international as well as public and private. When effectively implemented, humanitarian aid can lead to successful disaster management and help alleviate humanitarian crises during disasters. However, deciding on the actual distribution of aid and resources comes with challenges such as cost, time, coverage, and eligibility [5]. This can lead to tensions regarding who is receiving the aid, what aid is prioritized, and when it gets distributed. Beyond these dimensions, we must also consider the cultural nuances of where the aid is to be deployed and how all of these decisions get translated into action items. The criteria by which disasters are navigated and aid is distributed can have a direct impact on the effectiveness of various humanitarian aid efforts [6]. Additionally, depending on the perspective, these allocation decisions can be seen as unfair. But what constitutes unfairness? Fairness is subjective and there is no singular articulation of what it means to make decisions based on this conceptual value.

Our research aims to provide a more focused perspective on fairness within humanitarian aid distribution. We propose a Fairness Framework in humanitarian aid distribution that guides aid procurers and distributors in considering different fairness dimensions.

* ***RQ1:** How were aid sites distributed post-tsunami/earthquake in Palu, Indonesia in 2018?*
* ***RQ2:** What fairness concerns could this version of aid allocation lead to?*
* ***RQ3:** How can we prioritize competing definitions of fairness when deciding where and how to distribute post-disaster relief?*

To begin our research, we focused on the Sulawesi tsunami-earthquake to examine fairness concerns that arise during humanitarian aid distribution in natural disasters. We approached our research with an adaptation of the recursive Tripartite Methodology, starting with conceptual, empirical, and technical investigations [7]. For these investigations, we utilized stakeholder mapping exercises, reviewed literature and reports, and analyzed aid site data and satellite imagery to get a bird's eye view of aid distribution post-earthquake/tsunami (RQ1). We next examined the learnings and concerns that surfaced through the conceptual lens of fairness, considering potential factors that may or may not have been taken into account when distributing the aid sites. Through affinity diagramming and grounded coding, we aimed to uncover categories and groupings of various fairness-related tensions that could arise from this particular version of aid allocation (RQ2). 

From there, we explore how competing perceptions of fairness might be prioritized when deciding how to go about providing post-disaster relief (RQ3). To respond to this question, we developed a framework to conceptualize disaster management as a product of fairness considerations. As we completed one cycle of the recursive tripartite approach, we then iterated over the previous steps. Revisiting the data, literature, and stakeholder investigations in this recursive manner allowed us to refine our categories and incorporate additional generalizations into our Fairness Framework.

While the Sulawesi tsunami-earthquake of 2018 serves as the base for our research, the proposed Fairness Framework is evaluated to generalize across aid distribution scenarios within disaster management. By comparing the Framework to other frameworks, we narrow the broad scope of fairness to its specific applications within disaster management and humanitarian efforts. Through our Fairness Framework, we challenge those in positions of decision-making power to integrate and consider additional dimensions of fairness when tackling disaster response, recovery, and resilience efforts.
